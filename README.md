# TERRAFORM-PLAYGROUND
Learning Terraform with AWS examples.

This repository covers a simple-learning approach for Terraform and Packer with AWS. <br>
We will cover important Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts that support the best DevOps practices. <br>

## General Overview of this Repository

This repository is my own learning-playground for Terraform-based projects. It has different examples and the overall idea is to have fun with Infrastructure as Code projects towards AWS. <br>

The examples are simple, but they are a good way to learn terraform from "scratch". <br>


## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:

My advice is to primary understand the way Terraform works with basic tutorials, and then try to develop amazing project ideas based on these examples. <br>

### Software dependencies (based on project)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br>
Visual Studio Code is my main code editor for high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and GitHub easily. <br>

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) <br>
Terraform is a way to codify, automate, provision and version cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. The main purpose of Terraform is to create IaC for provisioning amazing infrastructure to different clouds. <br>


## Usage :dizzy:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O. <br>
I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible. <br>


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to all contributors of the great OpenSource projects that I am using. <br>
